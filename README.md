# Process Manager
# Viewpoint

This project uses a simulator for memory management and process scheduling to give a practical means to see and grasp several scheduling methods and memory allocation strategies. To assess the system's efficiency users may enter process details, select scheduling and memory management techniques, and get performance statistics and visualisations.

## Traits

## Algorithms of scheduling:
Shortest Job First (SJF) 
Round Robin (RR) 

## Memory Management Techniques 
First-Come, 
First-served (FCFS)

## Performance Measures for First-Fit and Best-Fit:

Normal Waiting Time
Average Turnaround Time CPU Use Visualisations
Process scheduling with a Gantt chart
Performance metrics using bar charts
